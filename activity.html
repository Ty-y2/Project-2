    <p>This past weekend i had a awesome competition at the lucas oil stadium with the band and my friends. 
        I got too meet many new people and im so thankful i was able to. 
        We still have a couple more competitions to go and im so excited for them.
        Im hoping we get better placement and do better than we have ever done before.
